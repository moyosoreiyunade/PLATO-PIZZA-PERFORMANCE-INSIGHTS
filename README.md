# PLATO  PIZZA  PERFORMANCE  INSIGHTS

#  Plato's Pizza Dataset
The Plato's Pizza folder consists of 4 excel files (orders, order_details, pizzas, pizza_types), and the data_dictionary. Each of the data were loaded into Power Query within Power BI for data cleaning.

# Data Cleaning
The dataset underwent thorough examination and cleansing using Power Query in Power BI with some key procedures like, renaming column headers and rectifying data types for precision, extracting the day name from the date column, changing the time format to short time and reviewing the data to detect and rectify errors, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

# Analysis and Visualisation
The use of report visuals portrayed important insights, some recommendations, and answered the business questions like what days and times do the business tend to be busiest, the best and worst selling pizzas, the average order value, how much money was made for the year, and the seasonality in the sales.
